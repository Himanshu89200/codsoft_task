# Simple Calculator - TASK 2
The Simple Calculator allows users to perform essential arithmetic operations with ease. It accepts two numbers as input and performs the selected operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, floor division, or exponentiation). Here's how the application functions:

Input Numbers:

Users are prompted to provide two numerical inputs. An operation must also be selected (e.g., + for addition, - for subtraction, * for multiplication, / for division, % for modulus, // for floor division, or ** for exponentiation). Execute Operation:

Based on the user's choices, the calculator processes the inputs and performs the specified calculation. For example: Input: 5, 3, Operation: + → Result: 8 Input: 10, 4, Operation: - → Result: 6 Input: 7, 2, Operation: * → Result: 14 Input: 15, 5, Operation: / → Result: 3.0 Input: 5, 5, Operation: % → Result: 0 Input: 15, 5, Operation: // → Result: 3 Input: 3, 2, Operation: ** → Result: 9 Output Results:

The computed result is displayed clearly on the screen, providing immediate feedback to the user.
